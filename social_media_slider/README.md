File: README.md:For:"Social_Media_Influencer_Template"

I created this Social Media Influencers slider from a file I copied from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M6qPoFWIxI , TraverseyMedia Youtube video. Brad gives credit to the originator of the file here is the link to her CodePen site https://codepen.io/rrenula/pen/DGrhf , where you can get the original version created with SASS.

All I did mostly was add CSS and a couple images to make it a little more appealing. I plan to add videos to some of the slides and use it to provide advertising for clients with accounts on the various social media sites. Rather than put my links I will provide links to the clients account. Hence the title "Social Media Influencers".

As of February 24, 2020 this is the file structure, the CSS isn't pretty. I am going to tidy it up a bit and update this file.

I am building a new website and I am hoping to be able to start providing Web Development Services soon, I will be including this elemnt into that design.
