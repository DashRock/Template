# gitCourse
Started out as a working file for a Git course on Skillshare, then decided to create a template to post on my website.
It will be a single page application with a slideshow and contact form at minimum, with the additon of Local Storage
setup to act as a surrogate to an AJAX, PHP and mySQL admin interface, which will be incororporated into a live site.
